Build Instructions for OpenADK (Java)
-------------------------------------
There are two options for building the OpenADK. The first option requires maven and ant. 
The second option requires ant only.

Maven-Ant Build
---------------
The build instructions for maven are taken directly from the instructions provided on the older Launchpad repository
and have not been verified since the move to Github. For details refer to the Readme_for_Maven.txt

Ant only Build
--------------
This is the latest version for building the OpenADK. It has been verified to fully work from within Eclipse and from
a command line. For details please refer to the Readme_for_Ant.txt file.
