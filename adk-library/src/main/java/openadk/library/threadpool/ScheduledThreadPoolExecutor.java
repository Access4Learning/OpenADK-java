/**
 * A replacement for
 * <code>openadk.library.threadpool.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor</code>.
 * The Java 2 platform ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor wraps the Tasks in a
 * private inner class. The inner class wraps the task in a private variable and
 * provides no getters to the wrapped task. The hook methods beforeExecute() and
 * afterExecute() are handed the outer wrapping class and therefore can not
 * access the original task. This variation of ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor
 * changes the scope of the wrapping class to protected and provides getters for
 * the wrapped tasks.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Delayed tasks execute no sooner than they are enabled, but without any
 * real-time guarantees about when, after they are enabled, they will commence.
 * Tasks scheduled for exactly the same execution time are enabled in
 * first-in-first-out (FIFO) order of submission.
 * 
 * <p>
 * While this class inherits from <code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code>, a few of the
 * inherited tuning methods are not useful for it. In particular, because it
 * acts as a fixed-sized pool using <tt>corePoolSize</tt> threads and an
 * unbounded queue, adjustments to <tt>maximumPoolSize</tt> have no useful
 * effect.

     *
     * 1. If it appears that fewer than corePoolSize threads are
     * running, try to start a new thread with the given command as
     * its first task.  The check here errs on the side of caution.
     * The call to addIfUnderCorePoolSize rechecks runState and pool
     * size under lock (they change only under lock) so prevents false
     * alarms that would add threads when it shouldn't, but may also
     * fail to add them when they should. This is compensated within
     * the following steps.
     *
     * 2. If a task can be successfully queued, then we are done, but
     * still need to compensate for missing the fact that we should
     * have added a thread (because existing ones died) or that
     * shutdown occurred since entry into this method. So we recheck
     * state and if necessary (in ensureQueuedTaskHandled) roll back
     * the enqueuing if shut down, or start a new thread if there are
     * none.
     *
     * 3. If we cannot queue task, then we try to add a new
     * thread. There's no guesswork here (addIfUnderMaximumPoolSize)
     * since it is performed under lock.  If it fails, we know we are
     * shut down or saturated.
     *
     * The reason for taking this overall approach is to normally
     * avoid holding mainLock during this method, which would be a
     * serious scalability bottleneck.  After warmup, almost all calls
     * take step 2 in a way that entails no locking.
