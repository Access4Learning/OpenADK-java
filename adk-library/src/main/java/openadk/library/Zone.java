/**
 *  A Zone is a logical grouping of applications that exchange data through the
 *  Schools Interoperability Framework. Each zone is managed by a Zone Integration
 *  Server (ZIS). Refer to the SIF Specifications for a more detailed definition.
 *  Agents developed with the ADK may connect to multiple zones concurrently.<p>
 *
 *  Zones have the following characteristics:
 *  <p>
 *
 *  <ul>
 *      <li>
 *          Each zone connects to a Zone Integration Server, which provides a
 *          reliable and persistent queue for the storage of messages pending
 *          delivery to the agent. The "connection" is a logical one. The ADK
 *          handles retrieving messages from the queue and dispatching them to
 *          the <i>Publisher</i>, <i>Subscriber</i>, and <i>QueryResults</i>
 *          interfaces registered with your agent's Zone or Topic objects.
 *          <br/><br/>
 *      </li>
 *      <li>
 *          The ADK provides a persistent and reliable Agent Local Queue (ALQ)
 *          for each zone. Messages retrieved from the Zone Integration Server
 *          are stored in the local queue before being processed. A given
 *          message exists in the local queue or in the server queue but never
 *          in both. The Agent Local Queue provides for enhanced reliability
 *          and supports disconnected communications with the server.<br><br>
 *      </li>
 *      <li>
 *          Each zone maintains its own set of properties. By default, a zone
 *          inherits its default properties from the agent. To set properties
 *          on a per-zone basis, call the <code>Zone.getProperties</code> method
 *          to obtain the zone's AgentProperties object, then call its accessor
 *          methods. Properties must be set prior to calling <code>connect</code>.
 *          <br><br>
 *      </li>
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  In order to exchange messages with a zone, the agent must be <i>connected</i>
 *  to the zone. The act of connecting establishes local resources for transport
 *  protocols and queuing. Depending on the flags passed to the <code>connect</code>
 *  method, the agent may also send SIF registration messages to establish
 *  similar resources on the server.<p>
 *
 *  An agent obtains a Zone instance by calling <code>Agent.getZoneFactory</code>.
 *  When finished interacting with a zone, call the <code>disconnect</code>
 *  method to release local resources held by the ADK as well as to optionally
 *  send a SIF_Unregister message to the server. Disconnecting all zones to
 *  which an agent is connected is easily done by calling the <code>Agent.shutdown</code>
 *  method when the agent exits.<p>
 *
 *  Agents typically use <i>Topic</i> objects to aggregate publish, subscribe,
 *  and query activity across multiple zones. Refer to the Topic interface for
 *  details.

	 *  with one or more Topics.<p>

	 *          If Agent-managed provisioning is enabled, the flags
	 *          flags have no affect. The agent must explicitly call the
